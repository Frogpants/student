## Welcome to my blog! 
This is a digital recording of my work and a few extra side projects.

## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles - # Read
Throughout working on this blog, I've had many ups and downs throughout my start of my journey in this amazing coding class. I've used the resources, such as below, they were quite useful when I was having issues. For example, I was struggling with adding images and other groups of code to my blog, but not only these websites but also my peers and teachers helped me learn and grow as a person.

I was given very useful resources that I also utilized when creating my blog. I was having trouble with the problems I previously discussed and each resource offered a step in the right direction, or fixing the problems/errors.

An example of a problem was adding a picture on my home page. The image below was the one my teacher had told us to make for our blogs.

The issue with adding this image was I didn't know how. Eventually after help with friends and my teacher (Mr. Mortensen) I was able to add in an image.

But suddenly I had a new problem! The image was blank, or it wasn't the correct image. I asked my partner, and he not only helped me and taught me something, but afterwards when he was having a problem with his image, I helped him because I had learned something else he had not.

Throughout the week, I had many other issues such as...

Along with having many problems, I also got a lot of support. One example of that would be the hacks our teacher gave us throughout the time we were there. On almost every page there would be a section called hacks that would always save me in a moment of doubt or failure. The hacks ranged from teaching me about how I would be graded and what I needed to do to get a good score to the installation hack which taught me shell codes for the terminal that was the best way for me to communicate directly to the operating system.

## More About Me

A few things about me:
- I love to program
- I started to program at the age of 6 (That means I've been a coder for about 8 years)
- I love innovating with code, or stretching the limits of it
- I work harder on things I'm passioante about (I'm passionate about coding)
- I want to go to MIT

I've always been intrested in science, but I never knew what. But one day at a summer camp, they introduced programming and at first I thought it was dumb and too easy (and this was as a 1st grader). But I eventually realized that all that was only true because they werent teaching on how to create your ideas, in a way, they weren't even really teaching, they were just telling. That day I went home and dug into my code and I finished my first ever project. It wasn't much but it was a working thing? I continued on to where I am today.

I originally started coding in python, but I've always wanted to learn javascript and C++. And although I still primarily program in python, I still always expand the limits of the language. My most recent project does just that. It is, in simple terms, a three dimensional engine that uses heightmap and texturing to create a more realistic looking enviroment compared to more modern day engines. The big difference between my engine and engines today is that most contemporary engines rely on the amount of polygons on an object. My engine on the other hand uses the amount of rays and detail of the actualy developer has put into it. In even simpler terms, my engine relies on the amount effort a creator puts in rather than the amount of polygons.
