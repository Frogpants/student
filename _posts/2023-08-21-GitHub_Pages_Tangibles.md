### Quick Overview of Hacks
Throughout my difficulties of setting up, I used multiple commands to try and setup my vscode and github account onto kasm. I had many struggles and failures but of course, I was able to get past that.

### Summary of Accomplishments
> Update Blog to contain all hacks.  
- make: Creates webpage or blog
- clear: Refreshes terminal
- make clean: Refreshes Files
- ls: lists commands and files
- cd: opens drectory
- cp: Copies files and directories
- touch: Creates an empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file

### Problems
I had problems with different directories and how to activate different parts of them. The commands listed above are a few of the commands I used to get a step closer to actually coding.
